Rick: Morty, we gotta test this TTS system. It's crucial for interdimensional broadcasting.
Morty: Oh geez Rick, I don't know about this. What if something goes wrong?
Rick: Nothing's gonna go wrong, Morty! This is cutting-edge voice synthesis technology.
Narrator: Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, the experiment was about to begin.
Morty: Wait, who's that narrator guy? Where did he come from?
Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. Just read your lines and sound natural.
Narrator: The scientist adjusted his equipment with practiced precision.
Morty: This is getting really weird, Rick. I'm not comfortable with mysterious narrators.
Rick: That's the beauty of multi-speaker TTS, Morty! We can have as many voices as we want!
Narrator: And thus, the test concluded successfully, proving the system's capability.
